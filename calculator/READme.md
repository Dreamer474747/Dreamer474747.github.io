# Things from my mini-project's ui that are different from the oreginal ui

### 1.the font of the numbers is different from the ui.

### 2.the + - ÷ × signs are different from the ui itself. in the oreginal ui they have there own shape but in my mini-project they are just manually entered by my keyboard, like - and +. for ÷ and ×, i have copied them from the internet since they don't have their own keyboard button(i dont like how the x button looks like. it does not look like multiplication sign to me).

### 3.the font of the numbers and signs in the output and numbers in the input of the calculator are smaller compared to the ui itself. in addition, compared to the original ui, input and output numbers have less distance from their top and bottom and left and right.

### 4.the background has a different color.

### 5.there is no +/- button. instead there is a ^ button which can raise a number to another numerical power.

### 6.there is no % button. instead there is a AC button which clears both input and output of the calculator. also, C and AC have changed their places with each other.

### 7.numbers and signs(and dot) are not completely centerd vertically. you can kinda see that its not completely centerd horizontally too. the last thing im gonna add here is that the dot in the ui is supposed to be in the bottom left part of the button it is placed in. in my mini-project, the dot is in the bottom part of its button but its in the middle bottom of the button, not left bottom.


well there you go, all of the differences that my mini-project has with its own ui which i found on figma. check the credit part to see the ui creator's page and the figma post of the ui that i used for this mini-project.(is it right to say "figma post"? never mind)
