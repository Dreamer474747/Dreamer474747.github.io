# Things from my mini-project's ui that are different from the oreginal ui

the navbar is supposed to be in the bottom of the header(which it is) and stick to the top until the end of the page(which it is not).

also i looked up the dribble shot again now. i did not know that the images were supposed to have some kind of slow motion zooming thing. that was new.

also we have that thing were you can choose one of the four brands and it gets choosed(kind of) and the background color of the brand gets some kind of a dark orange color and the arrow points to the opposite direction of the brand. we have that ok... so i did not know that the default of that thing should be a black and showing no product of any brand. so the default of that in my project is the product from the "Pracht" brand, and when you change it, it stays on the "Pracht" product, because we do not have any other product fron three other brands in the ui itself. i guess its supposed to be like that.

in the header, if you click on the <> buttons, one of the numbers above it will change.

if you click on the <> buttons in the header, navbar items in the end of the header, the numbers on the card shaped thing in the beginning of the main part of the site, the four brands thing i explained erliar, the "ABOUT US SERVICES BRANDS REFERENCES CONTACT" links in the footer, and the facebook pinterest linkedin icons in the footer, the item you clicked on will stand out from the rest. the one you clicked on will be different from the others.
