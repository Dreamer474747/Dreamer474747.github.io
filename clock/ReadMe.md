# Project description
This is a simple clock web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a black background with white and red clock hands that display the current time based on the user's device time zone. Additionally, the application displays the current date and the percentage of the day that has passed and that has remained, allowing users to track their daily progress. The clock is fully responsive and can be viewed on any device, making it convenient for users to check the time on the go.

# Credit
i have to mention that the idea of "the passed time and the remaining time of the day" is inspierd by someone else's work(which i do not remember who). only the coding of the idea is done by me.
