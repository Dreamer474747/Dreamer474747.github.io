# Project description
This clock project is a simple and elegant implementation of an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and updates in real-time. The hour, minute, and second hands are displayed on the clock face, and the clock also includes numerals to indicate the hours. The clock design features a minimalist black and white color scheme, and the clock face and hands are given a subtle shadow effect to give it a sense of depth.
