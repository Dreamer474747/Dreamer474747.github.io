# Project description
This clock project is a simple and interactive web application that displays the current time using hour, minute, and second hands. The clock is designed with a sleek and minimalistic aesthetic, featuring a black and white color scheme with a red second hand. The numbers on the clock face are also displayed in a clean and easy-to-read font. The clock is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is fully responsive, meaning it works well on a range of devices and screen sizes. This project is a great example of how to create an attractive and functional clock using basic web development skills.
